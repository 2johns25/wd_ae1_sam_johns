## Background

The Spontaneous Travel Company offer tours and sightseeing services to consumers through the use of autonomous vehicles, and have developed an API called Autoura, for third party developers to integrate their services with theirs.

STC require a solution be implemented, enabling customers to interact with the Autoura data. The required solution needs to be in the form of a single-page web application, build using a modern JavaScript framework. It would need to connect to the API, consume and process the data and display it back to the user in an interesting and user-friendly way. The site should also be hosted on the internet and be supported by a real-time database.

The resulting solution was a web application called London Sightseer, that enabled people to discover food establishments within London via a map and list of destinations. Using the site, users could visit individual food establishment own websites and favourite a particular food establishment, which would be seen by all other users, giving them an idea of what establishments were regarded as worthwhile.

The final solution can be accessed here: https://wd-ae1-autora.firebaseapp.com/
